# Travel Booking System

## Course: Internet Technologies

### Description
The Travel Booking System is a web application built using ASP.NET with C# and Entity Framework, designed to simplify the process of booking travel packages. The system implements role-based functionality, where regular users can browse available packages and make reservations, while admin users (representing the travel agency) manage the creation of travel packages by adding destinations and accommodations. Admins are also responsible for reviewing and accepting or rejecting user reservations. CRUD operations are implemented to manage the packages, ensuring efficient handling of destinations and accommodations, with secure and robust data management supported by Entity Framework.
